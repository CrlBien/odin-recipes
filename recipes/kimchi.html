        <h2>What is Kimchi?</h2>
            <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, 
                most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, seasoned with variety of spices.
                Kimchi is often served as a side dish in Korean cuisine but can also be used as a 
                main ingredient in soups stews, and  fried rice. It's well known for its probiotic
                benefits, as the fermentation process promotes healthy gut bacteria, making it not 
                flavorful but also nutritious.
