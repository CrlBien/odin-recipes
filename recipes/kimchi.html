        <h2>What is Kimchi?</h2>
            <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented vegetables, 
                most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, seasoned with variety of spices.
                Kimchi is often served as a side dish in Korean cuisine but can also be used as a 
                main ingredient in soups stews, and  fried rice. It's well known for its probiotic
                benefits, as the fermentation process promotes healthy gut bacteria, making it not 
                flavorful but also nutritious.

                    <li> 1 1/2 cups water</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups gochugaru</li>
                    <li>540g Korean radish</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
                    <li>3.5 tbsp salted fermented shrimp</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp raw sugar</li>
                    <li>90g Korean chives</li>
                    <li>1/4 tbsp minced ginger</li>
                    <li>75g onion</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the napa cabbage into quarters and rinse it in running water. Make sure the stem is intact.</li>
                <li>Dissolve the coarse salt in the water (16 cups) in a large bowl. Dip the napa cabbage in the saltwater
                     one at a time and transfer it onto a tray for further salting. Pinch some cooking salt (1/2 cup total
                      for all pickled cabbages) and rub over the thick white part of the cabbage. Open each leaf gently and
                       sprinkle the salt over the thick white part. Repeat this for the rest of the cabbage. Reserve the
                        saltwater from when you soaked the cabbage for later use.</li>
                <li>Put the salted cabbage in a large food grade plastic bag or large bucket (wedge side of the cabbage to be
                     facing up) and pour in the reserved saltwater from step 2. Close the plastic bag. If using a bucket, get 
                     something heavy on top of the cabbage to press down (e.g heavy pot with water).</li>
                <li>Once the soaking process is finished, rinse the cabbages in running water, especially the thick white part 
                    of the cabbage, to get rid of the salt. Place them in a colander and allow to drain for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>While waiting, prepare the glutinous rice paste. Mix glutinous rice flour with the water (1.5 cups) in a 
                    saucepan and boil it over medium heat for 5-8 minutes, until it thickens. Once ready, transfer the rice 
                    paste to the medium-size bowl and let it cool. Add Korean chili flakes once it has cooled. Then, combine them well.</li>
                <li> Prepare a large mixing bowl and add radish, fine sea salt, Korean fish sauce, and salted fermented shrimp. Leave it for 10 minutes 
                    for the radish to salt down. Add Korean chives, carrots, minced garlic, minced ginger, sugar, blended onion, and the Korean chili 
                    flakes mixture from step 5. Mix them well. Now the kimchi seasoning / kimchi paste is made, ready for use.</li>
                <li> Place a quarter of a cabbage on a tray. Spread the seasonings over each leaf. (You only need to season one side 
                    of the leaf.) 1 to 2 small fistfuls of seasoning is enough per quarter of cabbage. Repeat this step for the rest 
                    of the cabbage. Don’t pull the cabbage leaves off the stem, leave them attached so it holds together better.</li>
                <li>Transfer the kimchi into a kimchi container or an airtight container (and put the lid on). Leave it out at room 
                    temperature for 24 hours, then move it to the refrigerator. While you can start eating it once it’s chilled, you 
                    may want to wait 3-4 more days for it to develop more flavor.</li>
            </ol>
