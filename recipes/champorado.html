        <h2>What is Champorado?</h2>
        <p>Champorado is a traditional Filipino dessert made from glutinous rice cooked in sweetened 
            cocoa or chocolate. This warm, comforting porridge is often enjoyed for breakfast or as a 
            snack, offering a rich and creamy texture with a delicious chocolate flavor. Typically 
            served with a splash of evaporated milk or a sprinkle of sugar, champorado is a beloved 
            staple in Filipino cuisine that combines simplicity with indulgence.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 pieces tablea or pure chocolate</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups glutinous rice</li>
                <li>Condensed milk</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
                <li>8 cups of water</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour water in a cooking pot. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Put-in the tablea and then stir. Let it dissolve in boiling water.</li>
                <li>Add-in the rice. Let the water re-boil. Set the heat to low-medium and 
                    then stir almost constantly to avoid sticking. The rice should be ready 
                    when it absorbs the water (about 15 to 25 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add the sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Transfer the champorado in individual serving bowls. Top with condensed milk. Serve. Share and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
